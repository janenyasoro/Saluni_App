Technologies Required for Saluni.com:
Languages:
•HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Essential for building the frontend of the website and creating an interactive user interface.
•Python: Used for backend development to handle server-side logic, database interactions, and business logic.
Frameworks:
•Flask (Python): A lightweight and versatile web framework suitable for building small to medium-sized web applications like Saluni.com.
•Django (Python): A more comprehensive web framework that includes many built-in features, such as authentication and database management.
Database:
• SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL): Used to store user data, salon information, and appointment details.
• NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): An alternative database option that offers flexibility and scalability, but may require more complex data modeling for certain applications.
Libraries:
• React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which can be used to create dynamic and interactive components on the frontend.
• jQuery: Another JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, useful for enhancing the user experience on the frontend.
Platforms:
• Web: Saluni.com will primarily be a web-based platform accessible through web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.
• Mobile App: An optional addition to extend the platform's reach, allowing users to access Saluni.com via dedicated mobile applications.
Technology Trade-offs:
Framework Choice: Flask vs. Django
• Flask: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, making it well-suited for smaller projects like Saluni.com. However, it may require more manual configuration for certain features.
• Django: Offers a more comprehensive set of features out-of-the-box, including authentication, admin panel, and ORM. However, it can be perceived as more complex and may introduce unnecessary overhead for smaller projects.
Database Choice: SQL vs. NoSQL
• SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL): Provides strong data consistency, ACID compliance, and support for complex queries, making it suitable for relational data models in applications like Saluni.com. However, it may require more upfront schema design and scaling challenges at a massive scale.
• NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): Offers flexibility in data modeling and horizontal scalability, which can be advantageous for rapidly evolving data structures. However, it sacrifices some features of traditional SQL databases, such as transaction support and complex querying capabilities.
Decision-making Process:
The decision to use Flask over Django was based on the project's size and requirements. Since Saluni.com is envisioned as a smaller-scale project, Flask's simplicity and minimalism were preferred to avoid unnecessary complexity. Similarly, the choice of SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) aligns with the need for strong data consistency and relational data modeling, which are essential for managing salon and appointment data effectively. These decisions were made to optimize development efficiency and ensure a streamlined user experience without compromising on essential features and scalability.


6.CHALLENGES
